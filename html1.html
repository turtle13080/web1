  <h2>General relativity</h2>
  <p>General relativity (GR), also known as the general theory of relativity (GTR),
    is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics.
    General relativity generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation
     providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.</p>
